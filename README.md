##  Task 
The task is to fully complete [Pacman Project 2 - Multiagent Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html) from the set of [UC Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). 


## Conclusions

This is the end of the project specification. We hope to   enjoy executing it and hence learn a lot about techniques for adversarial search. 

## Acknowledgements

We are very grateful to UC Berkeley CS188 for developing and sharing their [UC Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) and RMIT  with us for learning purposes.
